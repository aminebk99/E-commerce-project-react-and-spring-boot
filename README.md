# Full-Stack Application with React, Spring Boot, and Docker

## üìù **Description**
This project is a full-stack application built with **React**, **Spring Boot**, and **Docker**. The frontend is developed using React, while the backend is powered by Spring Boot. Docker is used to containerize both applications, simplifying deployment and ensuring efficient operation.

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Frontend**:
  - React with modern JavaScript (ES6+)
  - State management using React's built-in tools or third-party libraries
  - Client-side routing with React Router
- **Backend**:
  - Spring Boot for building RESTful APIs
  - Secure authentication and authorization using **JWT tokens**
  - Database integration (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any other supported DB)
- **DevOps**:
  - Docker for containerization of both frontend and backend
  - Docker Compose for seamless multi-container orchestration
  - Database setup using Docker (e.g., PostgreSQL)
